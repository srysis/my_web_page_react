# My personal web-site

This repository contains the source code of my personal web-page.
This web-page serves as "proving grounds" for my skills as well as a way for employers to see projects I have worked on.

## Portfolio

Currently, it features six self-made projects and four 'training' project which are mostly replicas of existing web-page templates.
Self-made projects include:

+ A mini-encyclopedia about my favorite characters
+ Image gallery
+ A simple JSON editor
+ A 'proof-of-concept' online-shop
+ A full-stack forum
+ A personal 'recipe book' website

## What it was written in?

It was written using React.js framework with React-Router for client-side routing.
For styles it uses vanilla CSS3.
