# My personal web-site

This repository contains the source code of my personal web-page.
This web-page serves as "proving grounds" for my skills as well as a way for employers to see projects I have worked on.

## Portfolio

Currently, it has eight projects, four of which are replicas of existing templates. 
Other four are my own ideas:

+ A mini-encyclopedia about my favorite characters
+ Image gallery
+ A simple JSON editor
+ A 'proof-of-concept' online-shop

## What it was written in?

It was written using React.js framework with 'SCSS' for CSS preprocessing and 'React-Router' for client-side routing.

## How to see the results?

Visit [this page](https://srysis.github.io/my_web_page_react/).

## Source code

This repo only contains source code of the personal web-page.
Other projects are accessed by visiting their compiled version. You can see their source code on seperate repositories:

+ [Characters miniature wiki](https://github.com/srysis/characters_mini_wiki)
+ [Gallery](https://github.com/srysis/gallery)
+ [Replicas of templates](https://github.com/srysis/template_websites)
+ [JSON editor](https://github.com/srysis/json_editor)

There is also a source code for the old version of this web-page. 
It's design is rather outdated and primitive.
It can be found [here](https://github.com/srysis/my_web_page).
Keep in mind that it's not being updated anymore.
