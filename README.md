# My personal web-site

This repository contains the source code of my personal web-page.
This web-page serves as "proving grounds" for my skills as well as a way for employers to see projects I have worked on.

## Portfolio

Currently, it has seven projects, four of which are replicas of existing templates. 
Other three are my personal little ideas:

+ A sudo "wiki", where you can read some information about my favorite characters;
+ Image gallery, where you can look at some images of my favorite characters;
+ A simple JSON editor, that I made to train my skills working with JSON files.

## What it was written in?

It was written using React.js framework with installed SASS and React-Router modules.

## How to see the results?

You can either visit [this page](https://srysis.github.io/my_web_page_react/) or download the 'build' folder and open the 'index.html' file.
All pages should work locally without any servers with no issues.

## Source code

This repo only contains source code of the personal web-page.
Other projects are accessed by visiting their compiled version. You can see their source code on seperate repositories:

+ [Characters miniature wiki](https://github.com/srysis/characters_mini_wiki)
+ [Gallery](https://github.com/srysis/gallery)
+ [Replicas of templates](https://github.com/srysis/template_websites)
+ [JSON editor](https://github.com/srysis/json_editor)

There is also a source code for the old version of my personal web-page. 
Functionally it's the same, as the one saved on this repo with the exception being that it was written in HTML, CSS, and pure JS.
It can be found [here](https://github.com/srysis/my_web_page).
Keep in mind that it's not being updated anymore.

## Things to keep in mind

+ Some designs may be a bit basic. I am currently considering doing an overhaul of some pages, e.g. "About me" page;
+ Adaptive layout can behave a bit weird, since I don't have that many devices to test my pages on;
+ I am still learning, so expect some other unmentioned problems.
