				Welcome to my web-site. On this site I test my skills as well as develop a small portfolio for future employers. <br />
				It will improve over time and more content will appear. <br />
				This page contains only general information. The more elaborate version can be found by clicking on the link in the header

			<h3>About me:</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Denis. I am a twenty-two year old guy who wants to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can become a web-developer and turn into a full-time job.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering since I wanted to be a programmer, but as time went on I realized that advanced programming is not my passion, 
				so I decided to develop myself in Front-End, even though I liked programming and still do as an occasional activity.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a passion for modelling and animating. I may not be very good at it, but by the time of practicing it, I have learned a lot of things about visual clarity, 
				simplicity and general principles that can make a picture look good. But even though I really like working with 3D-graphics, 
				I often find myself burning out and not wanting to do it at all, so I decided to not make it a full-time job, otherwise it would be hard for me to enjoy the thing I really like.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also have an experience with game engines, specifically with Unity. I made a short game as my graduation project, that had one linear level, three types of enemies, 
				and pretty simple combat and movement mechanics. It taught me a lot about code and project management, as well as modelling and animating basics.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's pretty much all you need to know about my professional life.
